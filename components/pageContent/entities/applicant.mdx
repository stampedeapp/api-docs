<Property name="status" type="string">
  The status of this application. The value of this property will be one of the following enumerations, although please note that new values will be added as additional functionality is added. Calling systems should expect new values to be added to the enum from time to time. Existing values will not be removed outside of a major version upgrade.

    - `CONFIRMED`: The user has the application or registration fully confirmed. For an application, this means the user should be allowed to register for the event. For a registration, this means the user has paid and is fully registered for the event.
    - `CANCELLED`: The user has cancelled their application or registration. For an application, this means the user should not be allowed to register for the event. For a registration, this means the user has cancelled their registration and should not be allowed to participate in the event.
    - `DEFERRED`: The user has deferred their application or registration. This should semantically be equivalent to CANCELLED, with the distinction that the user should be allowed to register for the event in the future.
    - `PENDING`: The application or registration is not yet confirmed. For an application, this means that manual approval, or a ballot draw, is yet to conclude the application's final status. For a registration, this means that the registration is not yet finalised in some way. The user has been refunded for their registration.
    - `REFUNDED`: The user has been refunded for their registration.
    - `REFUNDING`: The user is in the process of being refunded for their registration.
    - `TO_BE_TRANSFERRED`: The user has requested to transfer their registration, but the transfer has not yet been confirmed.

    - `TRANSFERRED_TO_CREDIT`: The user has transferred their registration to credit to their account.
    - `FAILED`: The application was rejected (either manually, or through ballot failure) as opposed to being cancelled by either the Participant or the Organiser.
