### Learn how to get started with the Let's Do This Event Organiser API

The Let's Do This Event Oragniser API provides a REST interface for much of the data essential for the day to day operation of planning, promoting and running an Event.

In order to use the API, you need an **API Key**. Please speak with your Partner Success Manager to issue one to you. See the next section for more details on how to use your API Key to authenticate your request to the API.
