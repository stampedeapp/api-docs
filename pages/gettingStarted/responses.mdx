# Response Data

Successful requests to the API will generate a response in [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON) format. The response will be wrapped in a top-level object, and the result of the query will be returned in the value of the `data` property on that object.

In addition, many responses will be paginated and return a `page` property which contains data about the current **page**. See [PageData](/entities/pageData) for more details.

```json filename="Example Response"

    }
  ],
  "page": {
