# cURL

cURL is a command line utility available on most Linux and Unix like systems as well as Windows. It allows you to make network requests to a remote server (like the Let's Do This Public API) from your terminal.

You can send a `GET` request to the API in the following manner:

```bash
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.letsdothis.com/v0/applications" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN"
```

Query parameters must be [URL Encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_encoding) manually when using cURL. For example, setting the page size should look like:

```bash
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.letsdothis.com/v0/applications?page%3Fsize%5B=100" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN"
```

and not

```bash
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.letsdothis.com/v0/applications?page[size]=100" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN"
```
