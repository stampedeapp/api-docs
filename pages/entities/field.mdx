In theory any property type can be added to a booking. However, here are common property types that are used in bookings:

- `firstName` — First name of the booker.
- `lastName` — Last name of the booker.
- `emailAddress` — Email address of the booker.
- `status` — Status of the booking, see [BookingStatus](/entities/bookingStatus).
