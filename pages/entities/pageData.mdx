# PageData

When dealing with large amounts of data it is common practise to only return a subset of the data in any one request. This subset is known as a **page**.

Many of the respones in the API return two objects - a `data` object which contains the result of the query, and a `page` object which contains data about the current **page**.

You can use the cursors in `PageData` to query earlier or later pages from the overall set of results.
